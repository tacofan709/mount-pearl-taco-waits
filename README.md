# Mount Pearl Taco Bell Wait Times

A simple, unofficial community tool to report current wait times at the Mount Pearl Taco Bell.

## How it works

- Users can submit wait times for **Drive-thru** or **Dine-in / Walk-in**.  
- Wait times are tracked separately for Drive-thru and Dine-in / Walk-in.  
- Each type shows the last updated time independently.  
- Only submissions from the last 90 minutes are included.  
- Submissions are anonymous and limited to once every 15 minutes per device.  
- Times over 4 hours are ignored.  
- Times of 2 hours or more trigger a warning.  

**Note:** This is community-reported data. Times may not be correct and are for general guidance only. Not affiliated with Taco Bell.
