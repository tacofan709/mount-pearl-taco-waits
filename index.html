    <!-- FAQ Content -->
    <section id="faqContent" class="hidden">
      <p><strong>How does this work?</strong></p>
      <p>Community members submit the wait times they experience. All data is unofficial and for general guidance only.</p>
      <p><strong>What data is recorded?</strong></p>
      <p>Only the data you enter - time stamp, wait time, and if you selected drive-in or dine-in. We do not record any email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Should I enter a wait time to just test the site?</strong></p>
      <p>No, please don't! This site is only as reliable as the data it receives. There is no need to "test the site" - I've done that ;)</p>
      <p><strong>I added my wait time, but the estimated wait time displayed didn't show exactly what I entered - does that mean this is broken?</strong></p>
      <p>No. This website shares the median estimated time from the last 10 answers provided over the last 90 minutes. Just because you enter a wait time of 15 minutes (for example) doesn't mean that the website will 
        automatically dispaly an wait time of 15 minutes.</p>
      <p><strong>Why did you make this?</strong></p>
      <p>With all the excitement of Taco Bell's first standalone restaurant in NL, wait times have been very long (frequenly over 2 hours for the drive-thru) and I just thought this would be a fun and silly idea for people
        to share their wait times and maybe help others plan their visit to Taco Bell.</p>
      <p><strong>Who made this?</strong></p>
      <p>Hi! I'm Jeff Hillyard, a Mount Pearl resident who thought he was the most excited person for Taco Bell to come to town. Turns out I'm not the only one! I work for a local nonprofit as a program coordinator. 
        Wed Dev is not my dayjob.</p>
      <p><strong>Are you making any money from this app?</strong></p>
      <p>No. I'm not sure if there is even a way to monitize this, but I have no interest in making money from this tool.</p>
