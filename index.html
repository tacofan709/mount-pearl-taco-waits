  <ul class="faq-list">
    <li>
      <strong>How does this work?</strong>
      <p>Community members submit the wait times they experience. All data is unofficial and for general guidance only.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>What data is recorded?</strong>
      <p>Only the data you enter: timestamp, wait time, and whether you selected drive-thru or dine-in. We do <em>not</em> record email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, etc.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Should I enter a wait time just to test the site?</strong>
      <p>No, please don't! This site is only as reliable as the data it receives. There is no need to "test the site" — I've done that ;)</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>I added my wait time, but the estimated wait time displayed didn't match exactly what I entered. Does that mean this is broken?</strong>
      <p>No. This website shows the median estimated time from the last 10 submissions over the last 90 minutes. So entering "15 minutes" does not guarantee the displayed wait time will also be exactly 15 minutes.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Why did you make this?</strong>
      <p>With all the excitement of Taco Bell's first standalone restaurant in NL, wait times have been very long (frequently over 2 hours for the drive-thru). I thought this would be a fun way for people to share their wait times and help others plan their visit.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Who made this?</strong>
      <p>Hi! I'm Jeff Hillyard, a Mount Pearl resident who thought he was the most excited person for Taco Bell to come to town. Turns out I'm not the only one! I work for a local nonprofit as a program coordinator. Web development is not my day job.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Are you making any money from this app?</strong>
      <p>No. I'm not sure if there’s even a way to monetize this, but I have no interest in making money from this tool.</p>
    </li>
