# Mount Pearl Taco Bell Wait Times

A simple, **unofficial community tool** to report current wait times at the Mount Pearl Taco Bell.

**Live site:** [https://tacofan709.github.io/mount-pearl-taco-waits/](https://tacofan709.github.io/mount-pearl-taco-waits/)

## How it works

- Users can submit wait times for **Drive-thru** or **Dine-in / Walk-in**.  
- Wait times are tracked separately for Drive-thru and Dine-in / Walk-in.  
- Only the **last 10 submissions** are averaged per location.  
- **Submissions are anonymous** — we do **not collect personal data**.  
- Each user can submit **only once every 6 hours**, regardless of location.  
- Times over **4 hours 59 minutes** are ignored.  
- Only submissions during **business hours (10:30 AM → 1:15 AM NL)** are accepted.  
- Average wait times over **2 hours** trigger a warning message.  
- **Please do not submit fake/test data** — it affects averages for everyone.
